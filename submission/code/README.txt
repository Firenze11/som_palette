Instructions: To run the code, run "run_som.py" with python. From there, an SOM map will be initialized and shown in the fromat of randomized color grids. Then the image to be evaluated will show up and the training starts. After the number of iterations specified at the top of "functions.py", training finishes and the resulting SOM will be saved into "database.py". After that, the program will look through all the existent SOMs in "database.py" for the most similar one with the current image, and show that corresponding image.
