Instructions:

To run the code, run "run_som.py" with python. From there, an SOM map will be initialized and shown in the format of a randomized color grid. Then the image to be evaluated will show up and the training begins. After the number of iterations specified at the top of "functions.py", training finishes and the final SOM is shown. The program then recreates the image using the color palette in SOM, and the resulting SOM will be saved into "database.py". After that, the program will look through all the existing SOMs in "database.py" for the one most similar to the current image, and show that image.
